# PSLockScreenSlideShow
Set single lockscreen image or display multiple images as slideshow with Powershell

In contrast to the OS slideshow, each image will always be shown alone (no collage).
Images will be displayed in the alphabetical order of the filenames (no randomness).
Display time of each image can individually be defined as part of the filename.
